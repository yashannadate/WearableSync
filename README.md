**WearableSync** is a **Move smart contract module** on the **Aptos blockchain** for secure, decentralized management of wearable device data. Users can register devices (fitness trackers, smartwatches, health monitors) and synchronize health and fitness metrics directly on-chain.

The module provides a **trustless system** for managing wearable data including step counts, heart rate, battery levels, and timestamps, ensuring **full ownership, privacy, and transparency**.
